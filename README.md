The Intelligent Traffic Light System aims to address issues such as traffic delays, wasted time, and increased air pollution caused by idling vehicles at red lights. The system uses cameras to detect vehicles and pedestrians, adjusting traffic light timings for pedestrian safety and fluid vehicle movement, resulting in reduced waiting times and a more efficient road network. The system also reduces emissions, benefiting the health of those living or working near busy roads. The data stored in a database can be used by nearby systems to improve their traffic signal timing.
